## 📚 Research Implementation

### 🥇 DARKO-Inspired Features

**Research**: *"DARKO uses Bayesian Kalman filter + ML with comprehensive contextual features"*

**Our Implementation**:
```python
# Recent form vs season averages (momentum)
df['pts_momentum'] = df['pts_l5'] - df['season_avg_pts']

# Game context (home/away, rest, pace)
df['home_boost'] = (df['home_away'] == 'H').astype(int)
df['rest_advantage'] = (df['rest_days'] >= 2).astype(int)
df['pace_factor'] = df['team_pace'] / 80.0

# Opponent strength
df['opp_strength'] = (df['opp_def_rating'] - 100) / 10
```

### 🥈 XGBoost Synergy Model Features

**Research**: *"Synergy features capturing player-player cluster effects + team context"*

**Our Implementation**:
```python
# Position-based expectations
position_usage = {
    'PG': {'ast_weight': 1.5, 'reb_weight': 0.7, 'pts_weight': 1.0},
    'SG': {'ast_weight': 0.8, 'reb_weight': 0.8, 'pts_weight': 1.3},
    # ... other positions
}

# Team context and player role
df['usage_above_team'] = df['usage_rate'] - df['team_usage_mean']
df['primary_scorer'] = (df['season_avg_pts'] / df['team_total_scoring'] > 0.25)
df['primary_facilitator'] = (df['season_avg_ast'] / df['team_total_assists'] > 0.3)
```

### 🥉 Neural Network with Attention

**Research**: *"198 features per game with attention mechanism for player interactions"*

**Our Implementation**:
```python
class StatsNeuralNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, dropout_rate=0.3):
        super().__init__()
        self.layers = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(dropout_rate),  # Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty
            nn.Linear(128, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.2),
            nn.Linear(64, 32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(32, 1)
        )
```

    test_data = data[data['date'] >= week_cutoff]
    # Train on past, predict future
```
